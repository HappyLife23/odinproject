- Absolute and Relative links:

-- Absolute links: protocol://domain/path.
-- Relative links: länk till vår egna sida.

---

- Alt attribute
  Besides the src attribute, every image element must also have an alt (alternative text) attribute.

---

h1 {
margin: 1rem;
}

h1 = selector
margin = property
1 rem = value

- Chaining selectors = Another way to use selectors is to chain them as a list without any separation. Let’s say we had the following HTML:

ex:

 <div>
  <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
  <p class="subsection preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>
</div>

We have two elements with the subsection class that have some sort of unique styles, but what if we only want to apply a separate rule to the element that also has header as a second class? Well, we could chain both the class selectors together in our CSS like so:

.subsection.header {
color: red;
}

\*\* JavaScript

Programming languages that allow such things, such as JavaScript, are called “dynamically typed”, meaning that there exist data types, but variables are not bound to any of them.
